ðŸ’§ Water Quality Classification Using Machine Learning
Ensuring access to safe drinking water is a critical public health priority worldwide. Contamination from natural or human-made sources can pose severe risks to health, agriculture, and industry. However, traditional methods of water quality testing are often time-consuming, costly, and geographically limited.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a water sample is safe or unsafe for human consumption based on its chemical properties.

Using a dataset containing various water quality indicators such as:
ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Streamlit

Seaborn/Matplotlib (for visualizations)
